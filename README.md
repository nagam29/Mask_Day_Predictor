# Mask Day Predictor

"Unprecedented," "difficult time," these are the words we often hear recently with Covid19 outbreak. In this uncertain world, Mask Day Predictor lets you make informed decisions about your daily activities by telling you whether the outbreak is happening near you and how intense it might be.

We apply machine learning and Natural Language Analysis to the words in tweets that might indicate COVID-19 infection such as "fever" and "shortness of breath." This method is about 75% effective at predicting flu outbreak based on a research paper published last year.  Our application’s analysis outcomes become available to you through API, which interacts with Alexa, phone, and browsers.

With this application at hand, you no longer need to guess whether you should wear a mask that day or whether you should stay home. In other words, Mask Day Predictor gives you the power to make informed decision about your activities, which also helps you build your own life again in the world with new normal.
